### Hello, Kennedy here!

- ðŸŒ± I released the [Indie Smiths project](https://github.com/IndieSmiths) (formerly known as Indie Python project) on June 18th, 2022 (a personal project to promote fun and learning by developing and publishing free open-source apps, games and content)

The flagship of the Indie Python project is the [nodezator app](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/nodezator) and I work on it most of the time. Here's a screenshot:

I also released a playable demo of the first game of the Indie Smiths project on January 2023, the [Bionic Blue game](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionic-blue). Here's a screenshot:
