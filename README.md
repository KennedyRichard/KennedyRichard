### Hello, Kennedy here!

- 🔭 I’m [Kennedy Richard Silva Guerra](https://kennedyrichard.com), 32, he/him/cis
- 📫 you can reach me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@KennedyRichard">mastodon</a>, [twitter](https://twitter.com/KennedyRichard) or [email](mailto:kennedy@kennedyrichard.com)
- 🌱 I released the [Indie Python project](https://github.com/IndiePython) on June 18th, 2022; it is a personal project whose goal is to promote fun and learning by developing and publishing free open-source apps, games and content. The flagship of the project is the [nodezator app](https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator) and I work on it most of the time; here's a screenshot:

- 🎮 I also released the first game of the Indie Python project on January 2023, the [Bionic Blue game](https://github.com/IndiePython/bionic-blue), though it is at an early stage of development (works more as a prototype/demo); here's a screenshot:

- ❤️ Consider supporting my work at the Indie Python project so more free open-source apps, games and content can be produced and maintained steadily: [github sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/KennedyRichard), [more donation options](https://indiepython.com/donate);
